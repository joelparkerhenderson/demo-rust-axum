# What is this?

This demo is a tutorial that teaches how to build features from the ground up
with axum and its ecosystem of tower middleware, hyper HTTP library, tokio
asynchronous platform, and Serde data conversions.

## What will you learn?

- Create a project using Rust and the axum web framework.

- Leverage capabilities of a hyper server and tower middleware.

- Create axum router routes and their handler functions.

- Create responses with HTTP status code OK and HTML text.

- Create a binary image and respond with a custom header.

- Handle HTTP verbs including GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE.

- Use axum extractors for query parameters and path parameters.

- Manage a data store and access it using RESTful routes.

- Create a tracing subscriber and emit tracing events.

## What is required?

Some knowledge of Rust programming is required, such as:

- How to create a Rust project, build it, and run it.

- How to write functions and their parameters

- How to use shell command line tools such as curl.

Some knowledge about web frameworks is required, such as:

- The general concepts of HTTP requests and responses.

- The general concepts of of RESTful routes and resources.

- The general concepts of formats for HTML, JSON, and text.

## What is helpful?

Some knowledge of web frameworks is helpful, such as:

- Rust web frameworks, such as Actix, Rocket, Warp, etc.

- Other languages' web frameworks, such as Rails, Phoenix, Express, etc.

- Other web-related frameworks, such as React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

Some knowledge of this stack can be helpful, such as:

- middleware programming e.g. with tower

- asynchronous application programming e.g. with tokio

- HTTP services programming e.g. with hyper
